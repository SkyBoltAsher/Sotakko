This is a game I made in 5 hours to demonstrate my loathing for Tic Tac Toe. It is not fun.

Players take turns placing a number on the board, according to Sudoku rules. Whenever a player places a number anywhere such that no possible moves are able to be made in one of the 3x3 boxes, they "capture" that box. This is not the same as filling up the box, as numbers placed in rows and columns limit moves that can be done within a box. Once a player has "captured" three boxes in a row, they win.
